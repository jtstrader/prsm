# PRSM - Project Script Manager

Have you ever had a `utils/` directory with a bunch of scripts you ran to manage your project? Format a suite of different files types? Run various linters in sequence, or if you find yourself so daring, in parallel? Keeping all these scripts together can be a hassle and you might find yourself wanting to use some form of a script manager, typically within the language the scripts are in. So, for instance, if you have a collection of Python scripts managing your project you may want to use a script manager written in Python.

This is what that is, but it's in Rust.
